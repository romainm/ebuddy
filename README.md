To Read:

-   electron forge

Todo:

-   add computed current balance on accounts
-   search by anything (name, category, amount ("<1000 >30"))
-   graph past data by search result
-   ability to save search queries for graph so we can reuse it later on
-   all categories graphed for the past n months/years (and save as reusable chart)
-   net worth chart
-   transaction chart:
    -   per week, month, quarter, year quick grouping (button)
-   transactions:
    -   select all
-   use tabulator for now or find another table that supports paging or virtual dom
-   graph:
-   -   data should come from server using same filter. Potentially use a lot mor transactions.
